A. DESIGN
---------

1. Explain, in detail, the design of your new puzzle, and how it "connects"
to your common solver.

	The chess puzzle implements the puzzle interface. The puzzle interface takes a
generic type of puzzle so it will be able to take any type of puzzle. 	
	The chess puzzle still uses the same solver class, and same solve function to solve
the chess puzzle. For that reason, there is no problem with other puzzles. In addition, the solver
takes a generic type of puzzle so it can takes many type of puzzles to do the work.



2. What changes did you need to make to your existing design for part 2?

	There is no change for the solver and puzzle. I only have to implements the chess 
puzzle in order to get a correct neighbors of the configuration.
